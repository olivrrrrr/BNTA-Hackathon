## Problem Statement

Connectly is our BNTA Hack for Change project. Connectly is a mobile application that allows users to ***network, play and create community*** within their respective places of work. The objective of Connectly was to create an event planning platform that focuses on improving ***inclusivity and diversity*** within the workplace by allowing users to see all internal events at a given company as well as providing contextual recommendations for religious / cultural days. 

## How to Run this Project

Please note that there are some bugs that affect the UI on android, this app is best on iOS

## Planning

Due to time restrictions, we collaborated asynchronously. We were able to achieve this by using tools such as Google Docs, Trello, Figma and Github. 

We used Google Docs to write down ideas and meeting minutes regarding the Connectly application:

We used Trello to plan and delegate tasks to individuals: https://trello.com/invite/b/pXqOO2Jy/88065cf677f96d857958ccb5c9be395b/bn-hackathon

We used Figma to design our Client-side UI/UX:
